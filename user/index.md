## Colibri User Documentation

Welcome to the Colibri User Guides! This documentation is intended for business owners and site administrators of Colibri e-commerce sites. Everything you need to know to configure and manage your Colibri store can be found here.

Should you find any errors in these guides, or topics you wish to see covered, please let us know by joining, then sending an email to the [Colibri user mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/colibri-user).

If you are a Colibri developer, you may find the [Developer Guides](\developer/index) to be of benefit to you, though we strongly urge you to read through both sets of guides.
