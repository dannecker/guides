There may be times when using Colibri that the documentation doesn't answer all
the questions you may have. There are several other places on the internet where
you can go to ask Colibri questions, and they are covered in this guide.

## Mailing List

The first of these places is our [Google Groups mailing
list](http://groups.google.com/group/colibri-user). On this list, any user may ask
any question about Colibri and it's up to the community to answer it, or in some
cases, a Colibri employee may answer the question.

This list is perfect for *general* questions about Colibri. If you think you have
discovered a bug in Colibri, please [file an issue on GitHub](#github-issues).

Questions on this list may take some time to answer, so please be patient when
asking them.

## IRC Channel

The IRC channel for Colibri is at #colibri on irc.freenode.net. Here you can talk to
other users of Colibri in real-time. Colibri employees are represented in the channel with a `@` before their name on most clients.

If you do not have an IRC client and still want to join the discussion, Freenode offers a webchat solution for their network. [Simply visit this link, enter your username and connect!](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#colibri)

It is recommended that for people using IRC often, or on multiple networks that they download an IRC client. Popular IRC clients include: [Quassel (all platforms)](http://quassel-irc.org/), [XChat (windows and linux)](http://xchat.org/) and [mIRC (windows only)](http://www.mirc.com/).

## GitHub Issues

The [GitHub issues page for Colibri](https://github.com/colibri/colibri/issues) shows
a list of currently open issues on Colibri. If you think you have found a new
issue with Colibri, please first read the [Filing an Issue](https://github.com/colibri/colibri/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#filing-an-issue)
guidelines. If you provide the information we ask for there, we will be able to
help you with your issue much more effectively.
